# TACACS+ Docker Image

This image is a built version of
[tac_plus](http://www.pro-bono-publico.de/projects/), a TACACS+ implementation
written by Marc Huber.

## Tags

`latest`, `ubuntu`, `ubuntu-201904171831` - Latest version based on Ubuntu
18.04.

`alpine`, `alpine-201904171831` - Latest version based on Alpine 3.9.

## Building

Docker engine 17.06+ is required to build this image because it uses a
multi-stage build.

buildx is used to build multiple architextures.

It might be required to boot an instance of buildx using the following command:

```sh
docker buildx create --name mybuilder --bootstrap --use
```

 To build run: `make`. Add the argument `alpine` or `ubuntu`
to build a specific image.

## Additions

The Docker images include the Perl LDAP packages for Mavis authentication.

## Using

To run with the default configuration:

```sh
docker run --name tac_plus -d -p 4949:49 lfkeitel/tacacs_plus:latest
```

The default configuration has a user with the username:password of admin:admin
and the enable password is set to enable. Obviously, don't use this
configuration in production.

The configuration is located at `/etc/tac_plus/tac_plus.cfg`. If you wish to use
a custom configuration, simply overwrite it in a derived image or use a volume
mount.

By default logs go to stdout.

Port 49 is exposed as the server port.
